# MLOps Learning Lab

This repository is my structured space for learning Machine Learning and MLOps concepts.

I am using this repo to:
- Document notes and key concepts
- Practice Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, and monitoring
- Experiment with model serving and RAG systems
- Track my progress consistently

This is a learning-focused repository.  
Production-ready, end-to-end projects will be maintained in separate repositories.
